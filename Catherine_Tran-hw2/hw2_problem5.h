* This function determines if any part, including edges, of two

*
* If the rectangles do overlap, this function indicates that.
* If the rectangles do not overlap, this function returns the
* distance between their lower-left corners.
*
* @param rectangleOne one of the two rectangles defined by its
* lower-left and upper-right corners.
* @param rectangleTwo the other rectangle defined by its lower-left
* and upper-right corners.
* @return "Rectangles overlap." if the rectangles overlap. Otherwise,
* return "Rectangles do not overlap. Distance between lower corners
* is: NN.NN." where the distance includes up to 2 digits after
* the decimal point.
