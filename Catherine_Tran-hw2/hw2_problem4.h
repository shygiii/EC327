/*
* Converts a non-negative decimal, potentially fractional, number to binary.
* The result should be a string of up to 32 bits, where
* * the period is not counted towards the 32 limit
* * the string should not have leading zeros to the left of the decimal point
* * the string should not have trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point
* * whole numbers should not include a decimal point at all
* * bits should be used up to represent the whole number part first and
* remaining bits can then be used to represent the fractional part as
* accurately as possible.
* * numbers larger than the maximum integer that can be represented with
* 32 bits should return the string:
* "Input number too large!".
* * negative input numbers should return the string:
* "Negative numbers not supported!".
*
* @param num decimal number to convert to a binary fraction.
* @return a string with a maximum of 33 characters - 32 bits (1/0)
* representing whole and fractional parts of a number
* separated by a "." character as appropriate.
