The issue with setting the return type to "void" rather than "Node*" is that passing head by reference prevents any changes made to it from being recognized outside of the function insertInOrder's scope. head acts as a local copy, and if it were to point at the head of a resulting linked list, this may disregard nodes that were added at the front of the list or before head (pointing to head). head will continue to point to only the nodes that followed it in the original list.

We could address this concern by setting the function signature to the following: void insertInOrder(Node** head int newValue). head is now a pointer to a pointer to a Node.

The new function signature modifies the original pointer and allows us to modify the head pointer. However, this increases the risk of memory leaks or dangling pointers and other errors involving memory management. The original function signature, which returns a Node* pointer, is simpler and more efficient, still allows us to modify the nodes outside of the function scope, and still allows us to work with memory that has been allocated while the data size was unknown. However, this can be less efficient and still leads to the risk of memory leaks, dangling pointers, etc.
