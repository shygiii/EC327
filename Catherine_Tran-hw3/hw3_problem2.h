/**
* Reverses all of the input strings as long as they have an odd number of
* characters. If they are all odd, the resulting struct should have
* success=true and reversedStrings pointing at the resulting array of C-style
* strings.
*
* If any of the strings have an even number of characters, the resulting
* struct should have success=false and reversedStrings=NULL.
*
*
* @param inputStrings an array of input strings of length inputStringsLength
* @param inputStringsLength number of input strings
* @return success=true plus reversed strings as long as all strings have an
* odd number of characters, and
* success=false plus NULL if any of the strings have an even number of
* characters.


For this particular problem you should NOT use any built-in string manipulation helper
functions like strcpy and strcat. Your solution should only involve character
manipulation of memory allocated for C-style strings.
‚óè If you have already allocated memory for the result when you determine that one of the
inputs has an even number of characters and you are going to return NULL for the
reversedStrings part of the response, you must use free to free up that memory -
otherwise your code will have a memory leak
